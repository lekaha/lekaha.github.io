  I am a full­stack engineer. Currently, I am working in a startup­scaled company, which is my first time leaped at the

chance to work abroad. I am ambitious to change what I want to see in the world. I always give the maximum

contribution in my work and study hard in my personal interests, i.e., Machine learning, Data Mining, and Design

Pattern. I deeply love the things that can help people. Motto: Play hard and work smart!
